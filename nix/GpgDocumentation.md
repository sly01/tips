#### To install the gpg

**Linux**

**MacOs X**

#### To create a key

_While creating key required information will be asked to fill to them. Like which algorithm you will , username and so on._

```
gpg --gen-key
```

#### List keys

```

_This mail address belongs to owner of the key that you have already specify generating key part._

**You can see your key which is encrypted**

```
cat mykey
```

_Let's assume you send the key a person who wants to send a secret message using with your key._

**First He/She needs to import your key like this**

```
gpg --import key
```

#### To make a sure he/she can list the key if it is imported or not

```
gpg --list-keys
```

#### To encrypt the message (while encrypting it will ask which key you will use enought to write id,mail or username owner of key)

```
gpg --out encryptedMessageFileName --encrypt fileNameWhichWillBeEncrypted
```

#### Then assume you get the message which file name is encryptedMessageFileName

**It will ask to type your password for private key.**

```
gpg --output decryptedFile --decrypt encryptedMessageFileName
```

#### That's all you can see the contents of file

```
cat decryptedFile
```

_Setting Up a Blog With Octopress_

#### You need to install git,ruby and some gems then make configuration little bit.

##### Install the git and ruby

```
For Linux Users

sudo apt-get install git ruby

For MacUsers with brew

brew install git ruby

```

**Ruby version should be at least 1.9.3**

#### To upgrade the ruby version install rvm

```
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```

#### Then install let's say ruby 2.0

```
rvm install 2.0
```

#### Clone the octopress repo from git

```
git clone git://github.com/imathis/octopress.git octopress
```

#### Install the dependencies
**If you dont have bundler then install bundler first**

```
gem install bundler
```

```
cd octopress
bundle install
```

#### Install the theme

```
rake install
```

**For themes <https://github.com/imathis/octopress/wiki/3rd-Party-Octopress-Themes>**

**If you type `rake preview` you can see the page on port 4000**
#### Configure site title,author etc.

```
vi _config.yml
```

_Example_

```

```

## Deploying to GithubPages

**Create a new repository name will be username.github.io**

#### Setup github page repo

```
rake setup_github_pages
```

**Then type your repo. Assume that you have added your ssh key to github account.**

## Deploying to host(VPS)

**The difference is that you just edit your Rakefile to authenticate with ssh access.**
**Assume that you have added your ssh key to your host and installed a web server nginx,apache,lighttpd etc.**

_Example_

```
ssh_user       = "user@test.com"
ssh_port       = "22"
document_root  = "/var/www/test.com/web"
rsync_delete   = false
rsync_args     = ""  # Any extra arguments to pass to rsync
deploy_default = "rsync"
```

#### Create a post

```
rake new_post
```

**Type the title of post or article whatever it is :)**

#### Then edit your post which is stored in source/\_posts

_Example_

```
vi 2014-06-28-gpg-documentation.markdown
```

```
